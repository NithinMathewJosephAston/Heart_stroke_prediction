# Heart_stroke_prediction

Task:

You have been contracted by an international healthcare provider, who is interested in whether 
machine learning could be used to help them develop a user-friendly model capable of detecting 
a stroke in patients. As a starting point, they have asked you to create an ensemble system (2 or 
more Machine Learning algorithms) which, given some data about a patient, can predict whether 
there is a stroke risk or not (or give the probability of a stroke).

The medical teams provided you with a dataset which contains medical information of more than 
600 persons. They also indicated that the dataset does require some pre-processing. In particular, 
they suggest removing any row in the dataset which contains a missing (NaN) value. The columns 
are described as shown in the table below.

The team that you are part of includes both medical professionals and data scientists, and your 
supervisor informed you that the medical team highlighted a few requirements you must take into 
consideration when preparing the data.

From your client’s perspective, a good solution to this problem would predict (with reasonable 
accuracy) whether or not a new patient (i.e., one that is not in the dataset) was at high risk of a 
stroke. It is also important to them that the solution performs well for both well and at-risk persons. 
As part of your work, they would like to know how well they could expect your solution to 
perform on both counts.

Use your knowledge of machine learning and of Python, supported by personal research where 
necessary, to design and implement a solution to the problem described above and to answer the 
healthcare provider’s question about performance. Note that, as described in the marking scheme, 
you will be marked primarily on your approach to the task and your understanding as evident 
from your written justification rather than the final performance of your solution (although a high 
performing solution may be evidence that your approach is a good one). As such, make sure to 
include more than just your final solution in your write-up. Also include information on solution 
methodologies that you tried and rejected
