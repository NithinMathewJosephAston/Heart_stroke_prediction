# Heart_stroke_prediction

Task:

A machine learning model capable of detecting a stroke in patients. To create an ensemble system (2 or more Machine Learning algorithms) which, given some data about a patient, can predict whether there is a stroke risk or not (or give the probability of a stroke).

The medical information of more than 600 individuals is provided. The dataset does require some pre-processing.
A few requirements that must be taken into consideration when preparing the data are as follows:

1. Only features which are well known to contribute to the risk of a stroke need to be taken.
2. Will need to convert some of the numerical feature variables into categorical ones.

Here a good solution would be to predict (with reasonable accuracy) whether or not a new patient (i.e., one that is not in the dataset) was at high risk of a 
stroke. It is also important that the solution performs well for both well and at-risk persons.
